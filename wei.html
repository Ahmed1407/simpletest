        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>My name is Wei Chang. I am an Assistant Professor at Computer Science department at Saint Joseph's Univsersity.</p>
		<p>I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer and Information Sciences from Temple University, Philadelphia, and I obtained 
		my B.S. from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My Ph.D. advisor is Dr. Jie Wu. My home town is Beijing, China.

        <!--<p>this page is created with frontpage but you can edit it with dreamweaver - <b>it 
          utilises CSS and is vaild XHTML STRICT 1.0. it has also been tested in microsoft 
          explorer, mozilla firefox, netscape 8.0 and opera</b> - fingers crossed everything 
          looks ok! if this is not enough it also works in 800x600 screen resolution, 
          but is mainly for 1024x768.</p>-->
        <h2>Research Interests:</h2>
        <p>My current research interests include security, privacy, distributed systems, social networks, 
		clouds, and mobile computing. My thesis work is on social information-assisted distributed system design, 
		and its related privacy and security issues.</p>
        <p>In recent years, social network and its related theories attract a widespread attentions in 
		computer science. Considering that human beings are the essential participants in many 
		distributed systems, such as peer-to-peer video streaming and mobile cloud, more and more 
		applications have been designed by exploring the social feature among users. However, most 
		of the existing works only focus on how to use the social information, but ignore the fact 
		that social information itself may cause severe security and privacy problems. My research 
		focuses on not only the social information-assisted distributed system design, but also the 
		social knowledge-involved security and privacy risks in these systems. For more information 
		about my research, please check my Publication and Project pages.</p>
        <p>Most of my research works can be applied in Smart City-related scenarios, and therefore, 
		I choosed the left figure as my Home page's cover.</p>
